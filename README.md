# Weather Forecast Website

## Description

The weather website that was created here was made from the desire to create a simple and easy to understand website that displays the current weather conditions in a city plus the conditions of the next 5 days. The website is a dashboard in which the user enters the name of a town they wish to know the weather of. This will then bring up a current conditions and 5 day tab. This website was developed using the openweathernet api, which taught me the basics of attaching an api to a website in order to get more information than could ever be accessible by just me typing in strings of information.

## Installation

This project requires no installation for usage rather than opening the website, following the link in a browser of your choice, and then using the buttons to activate the functions of the website. The project was built using git bash and microsoft visual code.

## Usage
The website is to be used by opening the website in a browser, typing in the name of a city, and hitting the submit button. This brings up the boxes that contain the current and 5 day forecasts. The future development involves the completion of buttons that store past entries that can be pressed to open up the dashboards showing those previous cities conditions and 5 day forecast.

## Credits

The completion of this project was aided by the efforts and assets of the rutgers computer science bootcamp. The lessons and challenges from the javascript, html, and api sections of the of the class served as a backbone for the construction of this project.

## License

This project was completed using the MIT license.


## Features

The main feature of this website is the openweather.net api. When a city is entered into the search bar, the website shows 6 different tiles, each one with a different day's weather statistics, being an icon of that days weather, the description of the weather, the wind speed, the humidity, temperature, and the date. For future development, there is framework for buttons that store the past cities entered, and clicking on them will bring up those cities again onto the dashboard.
